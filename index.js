/**
 * What are loops? A loop is used to execute a block of code several times
 */

// EXERCISES 

/**
 * Exercise One
 * Title: Print all even numbers up to n (n being a number of your choice)
 * Description: Using a for loop prinat all even number up to and including n. Don't include 0.
 */
const n = 0;

/**
 * Exercise Two
 * Title: The even/odd reporter
 * Description: Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd
 * and report that to the console (e.g. "2 is even").
 * */

/**
 * Exercise Three
 * Title: Multiplication Tables
 * Description: Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For Each iteration of the loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and
 * log the result (e.g. 2 * 9 = 18)
 * Bonus: Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total)
 */

/**
 * Exercise Four
 * Title: Sum of Two Arrays
 * Description: Get the sum of two arrays
 * Example: 
    -> let arr_1 = [3, 5, 22, 5,  7,  2,  45, 75, 89, 21, 2]; // --> 276
    -> let arr_2 = [9, 2, 42, 55, 71, 22, 4,  5,  90, 25, 26]; // --> 351
    -> Example output: 
    -> 276 + 351 = 627
*/

/**
* Exercise Five
* Title: Reverse it
* Description: Using a for loopto  output the elements in reverse order.
*/
const elements = [43, 'what', 9, true, 'cannot', false, 'be', 3, true];


/**
 * Exercise Six
 * Title: Child making
 * Description: Given two arrays of integers. Add up each element in the same position and sum of each pair into child.
 * Assume both arrays are the same length
 */
const mom = [4, 6, 7];
const dad = [8, 1, 9];
const child = [];


/**
 * Exercise Seven
 * Title: isPalindrom
 * Description: Write a program that will check if two strings are palindromes. A palindrome is a word that spells the same forward and backward.
 */
let word = 'racecar';
